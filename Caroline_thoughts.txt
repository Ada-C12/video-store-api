###### THOUGHTS... 
customerInstance.movies_checked_out_count
  Go through customerInstance.rentals, count all the ones with returned: false


GET /rentals/overdue
  Option A: go through each customer? find customerInstance.rentals where returned: false && due_date < today
  Option B: go through each rental?
  I think Option A is best, b/c with optionB we might repeat the iteration for the same customer(s),
  whereas with optionA, as soon as that customer gets added to the JSON, we can move on to next customer

GET /movies/:id/current
  I vote for Option A, same reason

GET /movies/:id/history 
  Go through movieInstance.rentals, where returned: true (bc IN THE PAST)

GET /customers/:id/current
  Go through customerInstance.rentals, get all the ones with returned: false

GET /customers/:id/history
  Go through customerInstance.rentals, get all the ones with returned: true
