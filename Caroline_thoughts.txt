###### THOUGHTS... 

GET /rentals/overdue
  Option A: go through each affected customer? 
  Option B: go through each rental? No b/c worse time complexity
  
  with optionA, I search Customer for all those who has movies_checked_out_count > 0,
  then iterate thru and find customerInstance.rentals where returned: false && due_date < today

###
GET /movies/:id/current
  I vote for Option A, same reason
  Go through movieInstance.rentals, where returned: false 

GET /movies/:id/history 
  Go through movieInstance.rentals, where returned: true 
###


###
GET /customers/:id/current
  Go through customerInstance.rentals, get all the ones with returned: false

GET /customers/:id/history
  Go through customerInstance.rentals, get all the ones with returned: true
###

! Can probably refactor out some more between the prev 4 GET lines...
